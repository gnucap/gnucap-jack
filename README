jack interface models and jack command.
works with gnucap from dt branch on tool.

=== v_jack device implements jack controlled voltage source

parameters:
 - connect (unsigned)
   if positive. connect to the connect-th physical jack input port upon expansion
   (not implemented)
 - gain (real)
   gain. (not implemented)

=== m_jack device provides output to jack

parameters:
 - connect (unsigned)
   if positive. connect to the connect-th physical jack output port upon expansion
 - gain (real)
   gain. (not implemented)

=== jack simulation

.jack. starts jack simulation. starts simplified infinite transient simulation. (incomplete)

arguments:
 - sample{rate}.
   either 48k (default) or 24k.
   0=auto (not implemented)
